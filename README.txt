This program is designed to calculate Big Prime integers, specifically prime numbers that 2048 bits long. The calculations can either be done on the local machine or through a multi-threaded distributed system. To calculate Big Prime Integers, only run the BigPrimeMaster program. To calculate over a distributed system, run the BigPrimeWorker on one or multiple machines and then run the BigPrimeMaster.

The BigPrimeWorker will run on port 65000 by default, however, a different port can be specified as an argument. When run the BigPrimeWorker prints out its IP address and port and waits for a connection. To run the BigPrimeMaster, the user has to then specify the address for each BigPrimeWorker. The BigPrimeMaster will assume each BigPrimeWorker is listening over port 65000 so the user will have to specify IP:port for the BigPrimeWorkers not listening over port 65000. The BigPrimeWorker calculates primes for a certain period of time. Currently it is specified to 1 minute. However, the user can go and hard code that to be a different value. When running over a distributed system, the BigPrimeMaster will print out each large prime it receives from a worker.
